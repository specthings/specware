## Contributing to the project

### Python development guidelines

The project tries to follow the
[PEP 8 - Style Guide for Python Code](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/)
and the
[Google Python Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/pyguide.html).
If the Google and PEP 8 guidelines disagree with each other, the PEP 8
guidelines have precedence.

For documenting Python code, use the
[Google Python documentation style](https://google.github.io/styleguide/pyguide.html#38-comments-and-docstrings)
in the imperative form.

The [yapf](https://github.com/google/yapf>) Python code formatter with
default settings (PEP 8 formatting) is used by the project.

The `flake8` and `pylint` static analysis tools for Python with default
settings are used by the project.

Use type annotations for contributions.  The `mypy` static type checker is used
by the project.

Type annotations and the use of analysis tools is not required for test code.

### Tests

Use `pytest` for tests.  Run `make check` to run the tests.  Make sure the code
and branch coverage stays at 100% when you make a contribution.

### Conventional commits

Use [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org) for your commit
messages.
